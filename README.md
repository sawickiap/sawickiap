Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adam Sawicki, a graphics software engineer from Poland. Here you will find source code of my personal projects, but it's nothing very large or useful really. I recommend to rather check:

- **[My homepage/blog - asawicki.info](https://asawicki.info)**
- **[My Twitter account - @Reg__](https://twitter.com/Reg__)**
- **[My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsawicki/)**

I also have another GitHub account **[@adam-sawicki-a](https://github.com/adam-sawicki-a)** which I use in my current job, including development of open source libraries: [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator) and [D3D12 Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/D3D12MemoryAllocator).
